# debugger

Simple Python debugger with server/client model. The debugger takes in a Python file, runs the code and displays all output printed to the console, and returns errors with line numbers where applicable.

## Prerequisites 
You will need Flask which can be installed here: http://flask.pocoo.org/

## To run
Server.py should be running. The file address of the Python file that should be debugged can be passed in as a command line argument when using client.py.
